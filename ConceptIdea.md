I'll help you design a flashcard system for vocabulary learning using an LLM. Here's a conceptual design:
Core Components:
Vocabulary Management
Vocabulary database/storage
Each vocabulary item should contain:
The word/term itself
Definition
Context/usage examples
Related terms
Difficulty level (optional)
LLM Integration
The LLM would be used to:
Generate different types of questions for each vocabulary item
Provide varied examples and contexts
Evaluate user responses
Adapt difficulty based on user performance
Flashcard Generation System
Different types of flashcards:
Basic definition cards
Usage in context
Fill-in-the-blank exercises
Multiple choice questions
Synonym/antonym relationships
Word association exercises
User Interface
Flashcard display screen
Progress tracking
Options to:
Mark cards as known/unknown
Adjust difficulty
Review specific categories
See performance statistics
Spaced Repetition System
Track when cards were last shown
Adjust frequency based on:
User performance
Card difficulty
Time since last review
Flow:
Initial Setup
User inputs or imports vocabulary list
LLM processes each word to generate various question types
System stores generated content
Study Session
User starts flashcard session
System selects appropriate cards based on:
Spaced repetition algorithm
User's proficiency level
Previous performance
During Review
Show flashcard
User provides answer
LLM evaluates response
System updates user's performance metrics
Adjusts future card presentation based on performance
Feedback Loop
LLM can generate additional examples or explanations
Adapt question difficulty based on user performance
Provide personalized tips for challenging words
Benefits of using LLM:
Dynamic content generation
Personalized learning experience
Varied question types
Intelligent response evaluation
Contextual examples and explanations
This design combines traditional spaced repetition flashcard systems with the power of LLMs to create a more engaging and effective vocabulary learning experience.
